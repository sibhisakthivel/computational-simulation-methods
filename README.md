# Computational Simulation Methods

This repository contains a collection of simulation techniques I learned and implemented through the **UC Berkeley MSSE (Molecular Science and Software Engineering)** program.  
Each notebook explores a different numerical or statistical method used in scientific and data-driven modeling ‚Äî from deterministic ODE solvers to stochastic Monte Carlo systems.

## üìò Overview
The projects in this repo demonstrate how computational methods can model physical, chemical, or probabilistic systems.  
All notebooks are written in **Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)** and focus on clarity and reusability.

## üéØ Purpose
These simulations collectively reflect the quantitative foundation I built in the MSSE program, bridging **scientific computation** and **machine learning-oriented problem solving**.  
They serve as a technical showcase of the mathematical and algorithmic tools I apply in data science and modeling projects.
